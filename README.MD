How to Play

The goal of Simon is to repeat a growing sequence of colors and sounds.

Start the Game: Press any key on your keyboard to begin the game. The game will indicate the level (starting at Level 1).

Watch & Listen: Simon will light up the first color button in the sequence and play its corresponding sound.

Repeat: Click the same color button that Simon just showed you.

Next Level: If you clicked the correct button, the game will advance to the next level. Simon will repeat the previous sequence and add one new random color/sound to the end.

Keep Repeating: Watch the longer sequence, then repeat it by clicking the color buttons in the exact same order.

Game Over: If you click the wrong color button at any point in the sequence, the game will display a "Game Over" message.

Restart: To play again after a Game Over, simply press any key to start a new game from Level 1.

Challenge yourself to see how high a level you can reach!
